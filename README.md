# Unit 2 Project - PicSpot

**Purpose**
PicSpot was created to provide a rising social media stars with the hottest locations to create content for their media pages. Sometimes it is hard to create consistent content and keep up with a certain theme. This app will make that part easier by having user generated content providing locations that are great for influencer photography. 

**User Stores**
- As a user I would upload my favorite places to take pictures for my social media pages

- As a user I would like to know any tips for utilizing the locations ( i.e. where to park, the best times to go)

- As a user I would like to see any uploaded locations

- As a user I would like to delete locations that I have uploaded

- As a user I would like to update any locations I have uploaded

- As a user I would like to comment on uploaded locations

## Lessons I've Learned

- I've learned to utilize my time more wisely. I waited to do certain things until the very end and I underestimated how long it would take me to complete certain tasks.

- I spent more time with pre-planning, and I've learned that it's best to cut your ideas in half to make sure you can get the mvp completed by your deadline. 


## 2.0 features 

- I would like to connect the user profiles to the locations they upload and add authentication
- I would like for the user to be able to search for certain keywords within the locations
