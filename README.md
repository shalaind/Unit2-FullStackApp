# Unit 2 Project - PicSpot

**Purpose**
PicSpot was created to provide a rising social media stars with the hottest locations to create content for their media pages. Sometimes it is hard to create consistent content and keep up with a certain theme. This app will make that part easier by having user generated content providing locations that are great for influencer photography.

## Lessons I've Learned

- I've learned to utilize my time more wisely. I waited to do certain things until the very end and I underestimated how long it would take me to complete certain tasks. 


## 2.0 features 

- I would like to connect the user profiles to the locations they upload and add authentication
- I would like for the user to be able to search for certain keywords within the locations
